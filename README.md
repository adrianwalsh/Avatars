# Avatars

**Points to note**

- I did not work with any of the StoryBoards included. I have not seen a StoryBoard in production in around 7 years. 
They have recently been deprecated for VisionOS at WWDC so I could not advocate their usage. 

- I re-wrote the ListViewController using modern UIKit practices. I had planned a complete re-write 
using SwiftUI and Combine which would be my preference but the amount of work involved in the first task was prohibitive.
